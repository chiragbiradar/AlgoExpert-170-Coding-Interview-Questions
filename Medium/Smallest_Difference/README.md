# Smallest Difference

### Understanding the problem

We are given two arrays of integers. Both of them contain at least one element. We are asked to write a function that is going to find two numbers, one in each array, with the smallest absolute difference, and return them in an array. In the resultant array, the number from the first array should come first.

Example:

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
arrayOne = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]
arrayTwo = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]

<b>Output:</b> [28, 26]
</pre>
